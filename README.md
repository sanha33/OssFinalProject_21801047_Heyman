<h2>What does this project do?</h2>
This project is heyman GAME.
I made the name of the project, Heyman, to introduce a game that I want to recommend to a busy man to take a small break.

This game simply shows the number of words, and it is a game where you type the alphabet to gess what the word is.
It's a game that you can play with your frinds because you can save your score and user name!


<h2>Why is this project useful?</h2>

<h3>You can..</h3> 
play games while matching English words.

study words through the words'parts and meanings.

It's easy to see with a interesting design.

Through open source code, you can simply learn how to play the game, and we can refresh our mind through simple breaks.


<h2>How do i get started?</h2>

- Log in to your raspberry pie.
- Create a file to put code in a file inside a raspberry pie
- Clone (GitHub address)
- Create executable files using the gcc command.
- Play the game.


<h2>Where can I get more helf if I need help?</h2>

<h2>My contribution to this project: 40%</h2>

I basically used the open source code of the Hangman game.

I added the meaning of the word to the text file where the words are stored in order to call them randomly. 

So if you get the right answer or get the wrong answer, you can even print out the meaning of the word.

We have saved the user name so that users can receive new user admissions if they have already used it or not.

Also, basically, the ui of the game is not pretty, so I designed it to make the game cleaner and more fun.
